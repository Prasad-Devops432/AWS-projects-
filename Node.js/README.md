## ðŸš€ About This Project

This project is part of my ongoing learning journey in cloud computing and DevOps. While studying AWS concepts like EC2, IAM, Auto Scaling, and secure infrastructure design, I'm actively implementing what I learn through hands-on practice.

The goal?  
To explore, experiment, and refine my understandingâ€”while documenting every step to help others who are learning too.

ðŸŒ± Youâ€™ll find:
- Configurations Iâ€™ve set up during labs and assignments  
- Diagrams Iâ€™ve created to visualize cloud architecture  
- Scripts and policies that reflect real-world scenarios  
- Notes and reflections that capture my growth  

This repository isnâ€™t just codeâ€”itâ€™s my study notebook, lab workspace, and creative playground all rolled into one. Feel free to explore, learn, or reach out!
